# Methodology

## Analytical Lens
This analysis adopts an equity and access perspective, focusing on demographic and geographic differences in cancer outcomes rather than overall averages.

## Hypotheses
- Cancer outcomes vary significantly by state or territory.
- Older age groups experience worse outcomes across most cancer types.
- Certain cancer types disproportionately affect specific demographic groups.
- Outcome disparities have changed over time (2000–2024).

## Data Preparation
- Validated column consistency and missing values
- Created age bands to improve interpretability
- Grouped years into multi-year periods to reduce noise

## Analysis Steps
1. Examine overall trends over time
2. Compare outcomes by state/territory
3. Compare outcomes by age group and sex
4. Analyse cancer-type contribution to adverse outcomes
5. Identify high-risk population segments (state × age × cancer type)

## Limitations
The dataset is publicly available and may be simulated. Results demonstrate analytical reasoning and storytelling rather than clinical conclusions.
