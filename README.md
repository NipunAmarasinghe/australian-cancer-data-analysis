# Australian Cancer Equity Analysis (2000–2024)

## Overview
This project analyses publicly available Australian cancer patient data (2000–2024) to identify demographic and geographic disparities in cancer outcomes. The focus is on equity and access: understanding which populations experience worse outcomes and how these gaps have changed over time.

## Key Questions
- Do cancer outcomes differ by state or territory?
- How do outcomes vary by age group and sex?
- Which cancer types contribute most to outcome disparities?
- Have inequities widened or narrowed over time?
